# Project 2: Parameterizing Vertical Mixing Coefficients in the Ocean Surface Boundary Layer Using Neural Networks

This project reproduces and extends the analysis from Sane et al. (2023), "Parameterizing vertical mixing coefficients in the ocean surface boundary layer using neural networks." 
The study explores the use of machine learning techniques to improve the parameterization of vertical mixing coefficients in the ocean surface boundary layer.
