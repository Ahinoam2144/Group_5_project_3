# Project 3 Group 5 Statements

Team members: Ian Shuman, Kechao Lu, Ahinoam Toubia, Fangtong Mei

Summary: In this project, we enhance pCO₂ modeling in data-sparse regions like the Southern Ocean. We aim to improve the Large Ensemble Testbed (LET) modeling accuracy and reduce pCO₂ reconstructions costs, using Bio Argo masking and SOCAT mirroring techniques.

Contribution Statement:
Kechao found, uploaded, and cleaned the Bio-Argo data. Kechao also built the Bio-Argo masking for the pCO₂ reconstructions and created figures. Ahinoam started applying the hemispheric mirroring technique Ian built the SOCAT mirroring masking and running the ML reconstruction, plotted the figures and interprated them. Fangtong modeled and visualized resample in areas with the greatest bias to improve the ocean reconstruction results with fewer samples. Ahinoam wrote the introduction of the data story and the motivation behind the project. Ian, Kechao, Fangtong, and Ahinoam wrote the captions for the figures and the analyzed the results. All team members contributed to the GitHub repository and prepared the presentation. All team members approve our work presented in our GitHub repository including this contribution statement.
