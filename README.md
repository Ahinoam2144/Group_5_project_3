# LEAP Education
## Climate Prediction Challenges with Machine Learning
### Spring 2025 ([Syllabus](CourseInfo/CPC-Spring2025-Syllabus.md))

A project-based learning course where teams of climate science and data science students collaborate to create machine learning predictive models for challenges inspired by LEAP's research.

Material and links are being updated for 2025. Some links are for 2022; there will be some significant changes.
