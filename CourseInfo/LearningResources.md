## Pre-requisite Learning Resources

For this interdisciplinary project-based learning course, students from different background will learn to collaborate and solve challenging research-inspired problems together. To make such a collaboration efficient and rewarding for all members of an interdisciplinary team, it is key to learn each other's vocabulary and basic principles. In the following we list some learning resources on the basics of climate science and data science. 

### Climate Science
+ [Video lectures](http://forecast.uchicago.edu/lectures.html) (~10 hours) from David Archer (University of Chicago), author of the book on "Global Warming". Students who are unfamiliar with climate science should try to watch all the videos before the semester starts.  There is also a [coursera version](https://www.coursera.org/learn/global-warming/home/info) of this course. 
+ A coursera course by David Archer on ["*Create Your Own Models in Python*"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/global-warming-model) as a great way to learn about earth system models for data scientists who already know Python or not. 
+ Youtube videos
	+ [How does the climate system work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrPS2HiYVp8)
	+ ...
+ [Q&A: How do climate models work? - Carbon Brief](https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-how-do-climate-models-work), recommended by [Professor Laure Zanna](https://laurezanna.github.io/), one of LEAP senior researchers.
+  

### Data Science
+ [A collection of visual cheatsheets of machine learning](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-229/) by [Shervine Amidi](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/) and [Afshine Amidi](https://www.mit.edu/~amidi/). 
+ Google's [Introdcution to Machine Learning Problem Framing](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/problem-framing) (~ 1 hour)
+ Google's [Machine Learning crash course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course) (~15 hours). Students who are unfamiliar with machine learning should try to watch all the videos before the semester starts. Each section of the crash course has both a video component and some readings. If unsure, one can review the readings first to decide whether to watch the video in full. 
+ [Machine Learning Glossary](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) recommended by [Professor Laure Zanna](https://laurezanna.github.io/), one of LEAP senior researchers. 
+ ["*An Introduction to Earth and Environmental Data Science*"](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro.html) by Professor [Ryan Abernathey](https://ocean-transport.github.io/), one of LEAP senior researchers, which covers some data science tools that are valuable to climate science research. 
+ A coursera course by David Archer on ["*Create Your Own Models in Python*"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/global-warming-model) as a great way to learn Python for climate scientiets.
