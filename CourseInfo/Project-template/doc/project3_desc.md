Each team should organize the project repo on GitHub according to the structure of the starter codes. 

```
data/
GitHub_proj/
├──doc/
├────main.RMD
├──figs/
├──lib/
├──output/
├──README.md
```

##### Suggested team workflow


##### Working together
- Setup a GitHub project folder with everyone listed as contributor. Everyone clones the project locally and creates a local branch. 
- The data is too big to be stored on GitHub. You can fork the repo to a local folder for this class or all your data science projects and have the data stored in "../data/" from root. Your project folder may look like

```
local proj/
├──data/
├──GitHub/
├── README
```
